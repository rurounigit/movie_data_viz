Uncover the intricate web of connections that drive your favorite movie narratives with the **Movie Character Relationship Network**. This interactive web application transforms raw movie data‚Äîincluding characters, their descriptions, and the relationships between them‚Äîinto a dynamic, intuitive network graph. Powered by Vis.js, it allows users to effortlessly select a movie, explore the detailed connections, gain new perspectives on familiar plots, and reveal previously unseen insights into character dynamics.

## üì¶ Setup and Installation

This project is a static web application and does not require any server-side setup or complex dependencies beyond a web browser.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-character-network.git
    cd movie-character-network
    ```
    (Replace `https://github.com/your-username/movie-character-network.git` with your actual repository URL)

2.  **Ensure data files are present:**
    *   Place your movie character relationship data in a file named `clean_movie_database.yaml` in the root directory of the project.
    *   Create an `output/character_images/` directory in the root for character, actor, and relationship images (see "Image Assets" below).

3.  **Open in Browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
    ```bash
    # From the project root, open index.html
    open index.html # macOS/Linux
    start index.html # Windows
    ```

## üí° Usage

1.  **Select a Movie:** Use the "Select Movie" dropdown menu at the top to load the character network for a specific film.
2.  **Explore the Network:**
    *   **Nodes (Characters):** Each circle represents a character. Their size scales with the number of connections they have. Colors denote their respective groups.
    *   **Edges (Relationships):** Lines connecting characters represent relationships. Their thickness scales with "strength", and colors indicate "sentiment".
3.  **Get Details (Hover):**
    *   **Hover over a character node:** The "Character Details" panel on the right will display their name, actor, group, a description, and any associated images.
    *   **Hover over a relationship edge:** The "Relationship Details" panel will show the relationship type, sentiment, description, and potentially an image illustrating that relationship.
4.  **Highlight in Plot (Hover Character):** As you hover over a character node, their name will be highlighted in the "Plot Summary" panel below the details panel, helping you quickly locate their relevance in the story.
5.  **Graph Interaction:**
    *   **Zoom and Pan:** Use your mouse scroll wheel or the navigation buttons (top-left corner of the network) to zoom in/out and pan around the graph.
    *   **Fit View:** Click the "Fit" button (square icon) to re-center and fit the entire network into the view.
6.  **Click to Highlight:**
    *   **Click on a character node:** All other characters belonging to the same group will be highlighted.
    *   **Click on a relationship edge:** All other relationships with the same sentiment will be highlighted, along with their connected characters.

## üìÇ Data Format (`clean_movie_database.yaml`)

The application expects its movie data in a YAML file named `clean_movie_database.yaml` at the root of the project. The structure for each movie entry should be as follows:

```yaml
- movie_title: "Your Movie Title Here"
  plot_with_character_constraints_and_relations: |
    A detailed plot summary of the movie, describing key events.
    Character names in this summary will be highlighted when their nodes are hovered.
  character_list:
    - name: "Character A"
      actor_name: "Actor Name A"
      group: "Protagonists" # Or "Antagonists", "Family", etc.
      description: "A brief description of Character A's role and personality."
      tmdb_person_id: 123456 # Optional: TMDB ID for actor/character image fetching
    - name: "Character B"
      actor_name: "Actor Name B"
      group: "Supporting"
      description: "Description for Character B."
      tmdb_person_id: 789012
  relationships:
    - source: "Character A"
      target: "Character B"
      type: "Friendship" # e.g., "Rivalry", "Family", "Love Interest"
      strength: 4        # 1-5, higher means stronger bond (affects edge thickness)
      sentiment: "positive" # "positive", "negative", "complicated", "neutral"
      description: "Their bond is strong, built on trust and shared experiences."
    - source: "Character B"
      target: "Character C"
      type: "Conflict"
      strength: 3
      sentiment: "negative"
      description: "They have a strained relationship due to past betrayals."

üñºÔ∏è Image Assets (output/character_images/)

The application attempts to load character, actor, and relationship images for the info panel. These images should be placed in the output/character_images/ directory.

Actor Images: Should be named after the tmdb_person_id found in the YAML.

Example: 123456.jpg, 789012.png

Character-Specific Images: Should follow a specific naming convention:

[tmdb_person_id]_char_[slugified_character_name]_[index].(ext)

[slugified_character_name] is a lowercase, hyphen-separated version of the character's name (e.g., "character-a").

[index] is usually 1 for the first image.

Example: 123456_char_character-a_1.png

Fallback Character Images: If a character has no tmdb_person_id, the application will try to load [slugified_character_name]_char_unknown_id_[index].(ext).

Relationship Images: Images illustrating a relationship can be displayed in the "Relationship Details" panel. The application will attempt to load an image based on the names of the two characters involved in the relationship.

Naming convention: rel_[slugified_source_name]_[slugified_target_name]_[index].(ext) or rel_[slugified_target_name]_[slugified_source_name]_[index].(ext)

[slugified_source_name] and [slugified_target_name] are the slugified names of the characters in the relationship.

The script tries both orders (source-target and target-source) for the filename.

[index] is typically 1.

Example: For a relationship between "Hikokuro Omodaka" and "Hanshiro Tsugumo", the script would look for:

rel_hikokuro-omodaka_hanshiro-tsugumo_1.jpg (or .png, .jpeg, .webp)

OR rel_hanshiro-tsugumo_hikokuro-omodaka_1.jpg (or .png, .jpeg, .webp)

Supported image extensions (in order of preference): .jpg, .png, .jpeg, .webp.
